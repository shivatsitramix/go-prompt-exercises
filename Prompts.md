# Go Basic Program

This is a simple Go program that demonstrates basic concepts like functions, printing, and comments.

## Prompt

               1. Create a new Go file named main.go
               2. Import the required packages
               3. Write a main() function:
                  - Inside it, print "Hello, World!" using fmt.Println
                  - Comment why main is the entry point and what fmt.Println does
               4. Define a function add(a int, b int) int:
                  - Return the sum of a and b
                  - In main(), call add(3, 5) and print the result
                  - Add comments explaining parameters, return, and function call

## Expected Output

When you run the program using `go run main.go`, you should see:

```
Hello, World!
Sum of 3 and 5 is: 8
```

## Code Structure

The program consists of:
1. A main function that serves as the entry point
2. An add function that takes two integers and returns their sum
3. Detailed comments explaining the code functionality
