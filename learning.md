Learning in 3 days:-
In these 3 days of focused training, you learned how to **transform basic, vague prompts into powerful, structured developer-level instructions**. You went from casually asking for help to thinking like a system designer, using advanced prompting strategies like **Chain of Thought (CoT)**, **Tree of Thought (ToT)**, **multi-shot**, **role-based**, **scenario-driven**, **Interview Pattern** , and **context-aware prompting**.

You learned to:

* **Break down complex tasks** (like fullstack integration) into clear, modular prompts.
* **Specify backend and frontend behavior** precisely, aligning structure with functionality.
* **Handle edge cases and errors proactively** by writing prompts that anticipate failures.
* **Design your own development roadmap** and communicate requirements like a tech lead.
* **Turn vague bugs into precise debug prompts**, accelerating your problem-solving.

By Day 3, your prompts reflected real-world engineering depth — not just asking for code, but explaining why, how, and what needs to happen next.

**Prompting Errors in Day 1 & Day 2:**

1. **Vague prompts** – You wrote things like "backend not working" or "sync issue" without enough detail or context.

2. **No structure** – Prompts were not broken into clear input, output, problem, or goal sections.

3. **Combined multiple tasks** – You tried to do routing, file ops, and CORS fixes all in one mixed prompt with no order.

4. **Lack of technical clarity** – You didn't mention headers, request formats, error logs, or expected results clearly.

5. **Weak use of advanced techniques** – Your prompts were simple requests with no sign of chain-of-thought, role-play, or scenario-based prompting.

**Prompting Improvements in Day 3:**

1. **Structured format** – You used a clear breakdown of objective, input, backend behavior, and expected frontend flow.

2. **Specific context** – You included request headers, sample payloads, error logs, and behavior for each route.

3. **Role-based and scenario prompts** – You wrote prompts like an engineer assigning a task, not a confused user asking for help.

4. **Problem-driven prompting** – You described actual bugs (like date parsing or CORS), explained expected vs. actual, and asked for targeted solutions.

5. **Multi-shot and contextual** – Your Day 3 prompts linked previous instructions and built on past answers, showing a deeper understanding.
